# How to use OpenCorporates and Companies House APIs

In December 2018 I was involved in a story about [the collapse of bitcoin and the "human" cost of the cryptocurrency's fall](https://news.sky.com/story/behind-the-collapse-the-real-cost-of-bitcoins-fall-from-grace-11585936). I gathered and analysed the data using Python and the API from Companies House and Open Corporates. 

I wrote about my process in a Medium post and I am sharing my notebooks with the code to gather the information and the cleaning and analysis process in R.
